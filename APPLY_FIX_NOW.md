## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### 1. Critical Typo (✅ Fixed in code)
- File: `lib/supabase.ts`
- Fixed: `_supabaseClien` → `_supabaseClient`

### 2. Database Permissions (✅ Need to run SQL)
- Created system user for automated tests
- Fixed Row Level Security policies
- Enabled Realtime subscriptions

### 3. API User Handling (✅ Fixed in code)
- Changed from string "system" to UUID
- Uses: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

## ⚠️ If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check Browser Console (F12)
Look for these SUCCESS messages:
```
📡 Supabase Realtime subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
📨 LogsView: Received real-time message from Supabase
✅ LogsView: Added real-time message to logs
```

If you see ERROR messages instead, check:

1. **Environment Variables** (`.env.local`):
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJxxx...
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJxxx...
   ```

2. **Supabase Realtime** is enabled:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Settings → API
   - Scroll to "Realtime"
   - Ensure "Enable Realtime" is ON

3. **Tables exist** in your database:
   - Go to Table Editor in Supabase
   - Verify these tables exist:
     - `test_cases`
     - `test_case_executions`
     - `decoded_messages`
     - `users`

## 🎯 Expected Result

## 📞 Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Failed to create test execution"
**Solution**: Run QUICK_FIX.sql in Supabase SQL Editor

### Problem: "No logs available"
**Solution**: 
1. Check Realtime is enabled in Supabase
2. Verify execution succeeded in Test Manager
3. Check browser console for errors
